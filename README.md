# ImageCaption_Generator
 The Image Caption Generator project creates image descriptions using two models: VGG16 + LSTM and ResNet50 + LSTM. It prepares images with resizing, normalization, and caption processing, and measures accuracy with BLEU scores. Built with Python, TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV, this project applies AI to help images “speak” through text.
